// WhytCard-Cortex, UserPromptSubmit hook ("Frame before acting").
// On each substantive prompt, inject the single orienting question that carries the forces
// a good start needs at once: understand the real ask, separate what is KNOWN from what is
// ASSUMED (and go to the ground truth for the gaps), use the tools actually available, look
// one step ahead, and aim past the bare minimum.
// Guidance only: it orients, it never blocks. Always exits 0.
//
// A fixed `command`, not a per-prompt LLM call: the framing question is universal, so it
// stays free and instant on something that fires on every prompt. It steps aside only for a
// pure pleasantry (a bare "thanks" / "ok"), so it does not flood non-tasks.
// (REASONING-PIPELINE.md section 4, docs/DOCTRINE.md.)
