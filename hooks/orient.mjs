// WhytCard-Cortex, SessionStart hook ("Orient before working").
// At a session boundary (startup, resume, clear, or right after a compaction), inject the
// orienting question: where does this work stand, and -- above all -- what tools, docs and
// resources are available RIGHT NOW, so the agent uses them instead of improvising.
// Guidance only (additionalContext), never blocks, always exits 0.
//
// SessionStart supports additionalContext (verified, official docs, with a worked example).
// On the `compact` source it asks the recovery question instead (what essential thread to
// re-establish), because PreCompact itself cannot inject context -- so the "memory across
// forgetting" concern is carried here, through a channel that actually works.
// (REASONING-PIPELINE.md, docs/DOCTRINE.md.)
//
// This is also where the persistent side of Cortex surfaces: it confirms the plugin is active
// (visible feedback), re-reads the project's `.cortex/memory.md` and injects it so hard-won
// understanding is not relearned each session, and logs the activation. All of it is
// best-effort via cortex-store and silenced by CORTEX_LOG=0 -- the question always fires.
